Why I think AAPL might be done for,287,https://i.redd.it/a4uvww5e945g1.png,"* The iPhone is basically their whole business and upgrade cycles have completely stalled. People are holding phones for three years now because the innovation just isn't there anymore.
* The Vision Pro flopped hard at $3,500. Who's actually buying that? It feels like an overpriced tech demo that nobody asked for.
* China is a huge risk. They manufacture everything there while geopolitical tensions escalate, plus Huawei is making a comeback and Chinese consumers are getting more nationalistic.
* Europe is forcing them to allow third party app stores, which is going to kill their App Store revenue. That's been pure profit and now they have to share.
* The valuation is still pretty high with not much room for error. Any earnings miss and this thing tanks. I don't see how they're company of the year with all these headwinds."

Here’s Where ChatGPT Thinks AAPL Will End 2025,0,https://i.redd.it/hnja8qz9tf5g1.jpeg,"AAPL is December on stable footing as investors balance strong holiday expectations with the possibility that much of the good news is already priced in. An AI model using OpenAI’s GPT, analyzing recent price action and technical indicators, projected that from a trading level of $277.84, $AAPL would average around $280.75 in December, a modest uptick. With the MACD trending upward and the RSI in the mid-50s, the indicators point to steady momentum without signaling overbought conditions.

Looking further ahead, some AI-driven forecasts estimate that AAPL could reach about $514 by 2030. This is one reason I’m using GetAgent to plan an entry for a possible long position and also take part in stock futures rush competition.. The company’s fundamentals continue to impress, supported by record 2025 revenue of roughly $416 billion, healthy earnings growth, and expectations for its strongest holiday quarter yet, driven by demand for the iPhone 17 and the latest Macs and iPads powered by M5 chips."
🍎 🍏 🍎,0,https://i.redd.it/mi2qk097lf7g1.jpeg,"I know this sounds absurd, but I predict we trigger a lot of buying if we tap $270, maybe enough to break through resistance at $280, then we could see the high $280s again and possibly the $290s by Friday the 19th.  If that happens, decent time to sell off any positions you may have.
 
From there expect a pullback at the new support level [which should be $279 / $280] which would be a decent re-entry point.

Because the December / Christmas Rally was essentially subverted this year, there is a strong possibility the stock price will continue to rise post-Christmas.  

Expecting to be in the range of $305 to $315 before end of January Earnings, so once it pulls back from $295 down to $280, can enter semi-long positions there that expire end of Jan, Feb, or March.  

I know it sounds insane or absurd with the previous bad week and current declines today, but have seen stranger things happen.

https://preview.redd.it/rrb4emsha9f71.jpg?width=666&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae9b6972a707e0dc0302cfddb5f1e76cc4f553b3

So some glorious, generous ape (who would like to remain anonymous) went ahead and funded/launched another GCS survey, duplicating my methodology but swapping out $GME for $AAPL.

In other words, we finally have a control, and what is shows is **AMAZING!**

Before we get into the tasty bits, let me start by saying none of this is financial advice. Please do your own due diligence, question everything, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. My personal advice (again, not financial advice, but what I am doing) ... I'm buying shares of $GME, hodling shares of $GME, and shopping at GameStop every chance I get.

If this project is totally new to you, I suggest checking out the two links below.

The first link is my initial Google Consumer Survey post, and it contains tons of information about my methodology, research biases, sample size analysis, etc.

The second link was my most recent (and, I thought, final) post on this project. It also contains what was, at the time, my best guess at how many $GME shares I thought were in circulation in total. Although after seeing these AAPL results, my new guesstimate would be much higher.

Initial research post (with tons and tons of detail): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o2cnd4/using\_randomized\_representative\_surveying\_data\_to/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o2cnd4/using_randomized_representative_surveying_data_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Most recent update (with N=2,200 results): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/omdafo/final\_update\_of\_google\_consumer\_survey\_n2200\_at/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/omdafo/final_update_of_google_consumer_survey_n2200_at/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

For anyone new and too lazy to be bothered with the above links, here's the skinny (TL;DR) ... I used Google Consumer Surveys to model $GME ownership among a sample of 2,200 U.S. adults using a randomized, representative survey. With these results, I was able to extrapolate ownership across the whole of the U.S. While this isn't a scientific study per se, and it certainly has its shortcomings, I have discovered this to be the best shot we apes have at understanding the minimum number of shares held by retail investors.

# VERY IMPORTANT -- PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

**This research is intentionally designed to provide an underestimation of shares held. This research is not about providing the precise number of shares held, but is instead about establishing a minimum threshold for shares held. The thesis for this project is that U.S. retail investors hold more than the Outstanding shares of $GME, so more than 73MMish shares.**

**Two specific elements of the  research's ensure this is the case:**

**1) Survey response buckets of shares held (see survey links) were intentionally capped at 101 shares ... in other words, if someone responded to the survey and they have 600 shares, 499 of those shares would be completely excluded from these results; only the first 101 of their shares would be counted.**

**2) Coupled households have received a 50% penalty for all shares held ... the reason for this is to ensure shares are never double-counted, which is good, but at the same time this approach completely discounts coupled households where both individuals might hold shares in separate accounts, and it assumes all shares held in coupled households are held jointly.**

**The result: the derived number of shares held is most certainly a fraction of the true number which is okay, because again, the premise of this research was simply to show that U.S. retail owns more than the 73MM outstanding shares of GME.**

So without further ado, here are the updated results with the $AAPL control, as well as links to the actual surveys.

[If I have made any mistakes in the above maths, please let me know. I assure you any errors are not intentional, but I'd definitely welcome the opportunity to correct.](https://preview.redd.it/6bqkw9aka9f71.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=27e667d7278d0cbe1ce01ed7b207a36d73046406)

# So what does this new $AAPL control data tell us?

Well, for one thing, it clearly demonstrates what a massive underestimation this methodology produces. It's certain U.S. retail investors own way more than 367 million shares of Apple. In other words, this methodology is doing exactly what is was designed to do ... show just the tip of the iceberg.

While I had a very tough time discovering exactly how many shares of Apple U.S. retail investors might own, I can tell you it's a hell of a lot more than 367 million shares. Apple has about 16.5 Billion shares outstanding, and even with 11.7 Billion shares held by institutional investors (per [fintel.io](https://fintel.io)), and another 1.1 Billion shares in ETFs (per [etf.com](https://etf.com)), that still leaves about 3.7 Billion shares. Let's assume only half of these shares reside within U.S. hands, so that's 1.85 Billion. And let's assume half of these are with Insiders, family funds, or small institutions that don't report. So we are left with a paltry 925 million shares of Apple, compared to 16.5 Billion Outstanding. Even after we hack and slash our way here, it looks like this methodology, the very same methodology we used for GameStop, is producing an estimate that is at best only 40% of the actual.

Throughout the comments in my previous posts, people were clamoring for a control. Well, now we have one, and it seems to strongly support what I have thought all along ... hard data (really the only hard data we have) continues to suggest there is an epic buttload of $GME shares way, way beyond the number authorized by GameStop. And not just a few shares, but tens of millions, and likely hundreds of millions.

So remember ... no matter how much they say the squeeze has squoze, no matter how much they tell you the shorts have closed, no matter how many times they tell you you're wrong, it's just like Max Fischer claiming to get a handjob from Dirk Calloway's mom in the back of a Jaguar. It's nothing but ...

Before it was a company that had modest financials, uneven product success and was hampered by the dotcom bust (Similar to the altcoin wipeout we had in recent years). From 2001 it launched the ipod which was a niche product but slowly gained adoption over the years coupled with high earnings report in 2005 ($290mil compared to $46mil a year earlier) it was a catalyst boom to launch the stock to higher grounds.

I am getting the same vibe from XRP. It is a sleeping giant a monster brewing that has kept under the lid by SEC lawsuits and also the recent altcoins flushout. But the time is near where the fundamentals will outshine everything. Banks, financial instituitions will start using XRP as global adoption occurs. People who sell XRP at say $4 after holding it sub $2 for years would be the same as those who bought Apple stock sub $1 and selling at $2 thinking they are geniuses.

And when adoption hits forget about the 4 year cycles and stuff, that goes out the window... It will decouple from the cycle and it will mainly rise and rise with some drawdowns and flushouts but not 90% like before. The rise imo will look like APPL stock from 2005 to now but even more gargantuan."
