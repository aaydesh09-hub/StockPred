3 Reasons why TSLA will dump to below 400$ before end of the Year,1883,https://i.redd.it/y94dkj8u62zf1.png,"Yeah ya'll just clicked because you saw that fancy chart huh? But in truth we all know TSLA is immune to everything.

Buuuuut

Reason one: TSLA will dump after 6 of Nov. because Musks 1T Package will be accepted and its already priced in.

Reason two: I got puts, and I am always winning.

Reason three: Never trust your gut, and my gut says TSLA will moon.

Thank you."

$TSLA pattern literally paid cash for my entire Roadster,221,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1piulhv/tsla_pattern_literally_paid_cash_for_my_entire/,"It’s stupid pattern & super basic:

Two setups only:

1. Stock closes green + overnight is also green → next day usually opens higher… then dumps hard  
2. Stock closes red + overnight turns green → next day gaps up and finishes green most of the time

That’s it.

I checked the last ~18 months:  
- Double green → red day about 57% of the time  
- Red then green overnight → green day about 68% of the time

My lazy play:
Every time we get a red day + green overnight → I sell puts at the open (0DTE or next-day expiry, nothing crazy). Stock runs, premium melts, I buy the puts back for pennies or let them expire worthless. Rinse and repeat.

Double-green overnight days I either skip or buy some cheap puts for the fade.

Exception is when Elon drops a nuke tweet or real news hits.

Anyone else seeing this same thing?

NFA

Update:

Classic mean-reversion setup… It's essentially betting on overextension which is when the prior day and after-hours align in one direction (especially bullish), it often exhausts retail/institutional momentum, leading to profit-taking or short-selling the next morning. The red-day version works because the green overnight acts as a ""relief bounce"" after downside, shaking out weak hands before buyers pile in."
TSLA - expect sentiment shift after earnings,413,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1pohi6c/tsla_expect_sentiment_shift_after_earnings/,"With EV credits expired in the US as of end of Q3, early Q4 [reports](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/15/predict-elon-musk-reveal-tesla-losing-money-stock/) are already showing EV sales down up to 60% YOY. Assuming Tesla car sales will also be impacted *(+ remaining headwind from the political turnoil earlier this year + Chinese EV competition in China and Europe)*, Tesla may go from unreasonable P/E to negative earnings. While last quarter was somewhat salvaged by the last minute demand to get in on the US EV credit, this won't be happening in Q4.

While this doesn't necessarily change the long term picture *(whether you buy AV + robots thesis or not)*, I do think this will spook investors quite a bit and force a reality check."

This stands in stark contrast to the company's core business struggles, including a nearly 40% drop in European sales and institutional forecasts of declining Q4 deliveries. The truth is: Wall Street has completely abandoned fundamental analysis of TSLA's automotive business. They are making a massive gamble that Musk will successfully transform into the core of an AI empire $1.6 trillion market capitalization is just the beginning. What they truly value is the $1 trillion profit potential of the FSD software, the multi-trillion-dollar market for CyberCab and Optimus robots by 2026, and the epic narrative of the SpaceX space economy behind it all. This high-risk gamble, which completely ties personal wealth, grand narratives, and extreme valuations together, means that TSLA is a bet that will either reach $3 trillion or see its dreams shattered.

TSLA 700C LEAPS 2027 — Datacenters in Space,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1pnk24g/tsla_700c_leaps_2027_datacenters_in_space/,"Alright regards, quick thesis because attention spans here are shorter than a 0DTE lifespan.

I’m buying TSLA $700 LEAPS Jan 2027.

Not because of cars. Not because of deliveries.

Because you’re all still valuing Tesla like it’s an auto OEM while Elon is building compute infrastructure for the planet and beyond it.

The Actual Play: Compute, Power, Space

Everyone’s arguing PE ratios while Elon is on X talking about compute constraints being the real bottleneck for AI.

Now connect the dots:

xAI needs absurd amounts of compute

Tesla builds AI, chips (Dojo), power systems, cooling, energy storage

SpaceX owns launch + Starlink (global low-latency data backbone)

What do you get?

Datacenters in space / near-space

No land constraints

Solar power abundance

Global latency via Starlink

Energy storage via Tesla Megapacks

AI training + inference at planetary scale

This isn’t sci-fi. Elon has explicitly said power + compute are the limiting factors for AI — and he controls both.

Why Tesla Is the Trojan Horse

Tesla isn’t the product.

Tesla is the industrial base:

Energy generation

Energy storage

AI hardware

Robotics to build and maintain it

Try slapping a PE ratio on that. I’ll wait.

Risk?

Yeah, TSLA could easily nuke 50% in 6 months.

That’s why:

TL;DR

You’re trading a car company

I’m betting on orbital compute infrastructure

Evaluating TSLA as It Approaches the $500 Leve,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1pf6tae/evaluating_tsla_as_it_approaches_the_500_leve/,"Recent market volatility has been largely driven by macro shifts, but Tesla (TSLA) continues to attract attention as it approaches the $500 mark. While sentiment is improving, the investment discussion still revolves around fundamentals margins, long-term competitive positioning, and how much future growth is already priced in.

For value-oriented investors, the main considerations remain Tesla’s ability to sustain profitability, scale its energy segment, and maintain cost advantages in a competitive EV landscape. A move above $500 would be notable, but the long-term thesis matters more than short-term price action.

For transparency, I personally monitor TSLA through a stock-futures product on my trading platform (Bitget) mainly as a way to track broader sentiment. This is not a recommendation just part of how I follow market movements while evaluating the underlying fundamentals.

Overall, I’m keeping a balanced view and focusing on whether future cash-flow potential justifies the current and potential valuation levels."
Don't celebrate the Fed Cut yet. TSLA is the canary in the coal mine and signals the market is facing a 25-30% correction in 2026,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1pj892w/dont_celebrate_the_fed_cut_yet_tsla_is_the_canary/,"I'm shorting this optimism. Everyone is glued to the screen waiting for the Fed to cut rates today, acting like it’s a foregone conclusion, and analysts are talking about S&P 500 hitting 7,500 in 2026. That's pure euphoria.

I look at one stock: Tesla (TSLA). Michael Burry, the ""Big Short"" investor, recently called the company ""ridiculously overvalued,"" citing shareholder dilution from stock-based compensation (SBC) and no buyback program.

1 - The Growth Narrative is Broken: The stock's valuation requires insane, uninterrupted growth, but the truck design is already controversial, and the competition is accelerating. It has an AI valuation but is fundamentally a car company.

2 - The EPS Overestimation: The bottom-up EPS estimate for the S&P 500 for 2026 is currently \$309.22. However, over the past 25 years, analysts have overestimated the final EPS number by an average of 6.2\%. Applying that average means the final 2026 EPS might be closer to \$290.11. This makes current high valuations extremely sensitive to any shock.

The market is showing extreme crowding and a ""winner-takes-all"" dynamic right now. When the high-momentum stocks like TSLA and other AI names start the rotation, the correction will be deep. I'm taking profits today. I’m not saying crash, but 25-30% pullback in 2026 is my base case. Roast me.

TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,18880,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j7l0bv/tsla_being_investigated_by_transport_canada_for/,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines.

Why TSLA is a buy.,2381,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/1js68xu/why_tsla_is_a_buy/,"**Intro**

Okay, so Telsa has had not the greatest of starts to the year. With the stock being down something like 50% from the top.

But sometimes one just needs to take a step back and remember what is going on at Tesla and why it will make the stock pop off.

**The Cyberbeast**

Tesla now has a killer truck on the market. Sharp, angular, fast and just absolutely kills. Sure, it's had a couple of recalls (8) but that's just normal for all new cars on the market.

**Not just a car company**

One thing to remember about Tesla is that it's not just a car company it's also a bet on taxis. You know that thing you use like once or twice a year. Man I wish Tesla was a taxi company. Then we could be valued like Waymo or Uber and not like a boring car company.

Oh, and Tesla also does these robots that are really cool. That definitely are 100% AI* (actually interns). I think there is this other company called boston dynamics also doing robots and they where sold to Hyundai for 1.1 billion dollars. Now that's a lot of money.

**Valuation**

Man, Teslas current valuation just sucks. I just don't see why people aren't more hype about the company. The P/E is a modest 117, a couple of weeks ago it was closer to 200. But I guess it's fine. The other MAG 7 are like in their 30s.

**Brand**

On a more positive note, Teslas brand image is on fire. Like, literally. And people are just going to want to se it becoming brighter now with Elon Musk work at DOGE.

**Conclusion**

At the end of the day, you just have to zoom out. Way out. Like, to a level where fundamentals, earnings, and reality don’t really matter. And when you do that? Then it all just makes perfect sense.

Keeping all of this in mind, this isn’t even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk’s Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. 

On the day of Tesla’s Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. 

On the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn’t tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. 

Seems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he’s in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. 

Now guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? 

*15 fucking times*. 

You heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That’s triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn’t, and he’s letting us know right below our own nose! 

All of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I’m betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk’s tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. 

This is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. 

Positions: 15 minutes before market close, I’ll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th.

What do you think is going through Elons mind right now now?

TSLA earnings call tomorrow. He is probably losing his mind…. Will TSLA hit 10$ in a few years, go bankrupt, or even with a new CEO, the brand is wrecked. "
